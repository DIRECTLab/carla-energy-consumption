# How to setup the conda env for the CarlaCharge client

1. Open a terminal.
1. Navigate to [demo_helper_scripts/](../demo_helper_scripts/)
1. Run the [client.sh](../demo_helper_scripts/client.sh) script with the install option `-i` passed.
    * Command: `./client.sh -i`

This will install and setup the `carlaclient-env` conda environment. You should now be able to activate it and run the demo.
