    "## Normalized Lane-and-Vehicle-Width-Independent Representation of Lane Positions"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Normalized lane-and-vehcile-width-independent positions represent a vehicle's position in a lane proportionally to the empty space on both sides of a vehicle within the lane it is travelling in. This normalized lane offset value expresses this in terms of 1/2 of the lane width, excluding the width of the vehicle in the lane `(0.5 * (lane_width - vehicle_width))`, with the sign indicating if the vehicle is offset towards the left or right line of the lane. This describes a vehicle lane position in a lane-and-vehicle-width-independent way, where the values of 1 and -1 represent the vehicle driving with its right and left edge/side against the right and left road line, respectively, and 0 represents the vehicle driving in the center of the lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of this representation comes in that it describes the position within a lane that a driver drives in relative to the available space in the lane, which varies based on the size of the vehicle, according to typical driving behavior that tries to always stay in their lane. (Ex. a semi truck will generally stay centered as they often do not have much horizontal space in a lane to manuver within, compared to a sedan). Using a lane-size-independent representation that does not account for the width of the vehicle (ex. normalized vehicle center offset) can result in unintended overlap into adjacent lanes if applying such an offset to a vehicle with a width other than the vehicle width used as reference when determining the offset (whether arbitrary or recorded from actual data). The lane-and-vehicle-width-independent representation of lane offsets is therefore more general, though it does give up a bit of direct control over certain aspects without extra computation, compared to absolute or center-based offsets that do not adjust based on vehicle width. Aspects such as defining a specific number of meters of overlap into adjacent lanes, which would be better served by absolute offsets, is one such example where this representation is not the best choice. For the charging efficiency based on lane position for wireless charging in-road, this representation is more appropriate as it describes the vehicle's position in the lane relative to the available space in the lane, mirroring typical driving behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurately simulating a real power consumption of wireless chargers is also dependent on simulating accurately the distribution of vehicle types on the road, as the width of a vehicle does have impact on where a driver drives in a lane as larger vehicles have less space in a lane as they take up more of it. This is generally applicable regardless of the lane offset representation type used. For this representation, it helps reduce variability. This representation is also more useful in simulation environments where a vehicle may travel through lanes of different widths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting Lane Position Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0: Vehicle is in center of the lane\n",
    "- -1: Vehicle drives with its left edge/side against the left road line\n",
    "- 1: Vehicle drives with its right edge/side against the right road line\n",
    "- Values greater than or smaller than -1 or 1 indicate that the vehicle is overlapping/encroaching into the adjacent lane.\n",
    "- Values between 1 and -1, excluding 0, indicate that the vehicle is driving in the lane but not in the center.\n"
