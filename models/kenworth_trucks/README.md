1. [kenworthTruck_Old.fbx](./kenworthTruck_Old.fbx), this is the fbx file which works to import the kenworth truck model into CarlaUE4. 
2. [kenworthTruck_Updated.fbx](./kenworthTruck_Updated.fbx), I edited the old fbx file slightly in blender and removed most of the materials to make it simpler to be able to import into CarlaUE5. I found that CarlaUE5 has some general materials that come with it which were actually better looking than the materials on the old fbx model.

## Old Text in here, could still be helpful. Not sure if those assets are still there.
* This folder contains instructions for creating new vehicles in CARLA as well as files of already created vehicles.
* The files used to create the kenworth truck for CARLA are on the computer running the server in the folder `kenworth_truck_assets`.
* Blender is on the same computer as well as the build from source CARLA that allows for adding custom vehicles.
