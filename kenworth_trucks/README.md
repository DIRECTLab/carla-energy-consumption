### This folder contains instructions for creating new vehicles in CARLA as well as files of already created vehicles.
The files used to create the kenworth truck for CARLA are on the computer running the server in the folder `kenworth_truck_assets`. Blender is on the same computer as well as the build from source CARLA that allows for adding custom vehicles.
